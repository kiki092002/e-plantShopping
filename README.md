ePlant Shopping
Welcome to the ePlant Shopping application! This is an eCommerce application built using React, Redux, and hooks to simulate a shopping experience for plant enthusiasts.

Features
React Hooks: Utilizes React's useState and useEffect hooks to manage component-level states efficiently.

Redux Integration: Redux is used for state management across the app. Actions, reducers, and the store are implemented to handle the state flow.

Dynamic Rendering: Data fetched from an array of plant objects is dynamically rendered to the UI. Plant items are displayed as a list generated by mapping over the array.

Cart Management: Users can add and remove plants to/from their cart. Each action is triggered by user events such as button clicks, and corresponding actions are dispatched to update the cart state.

Cart Icon Update: The shopping cart icon in the header dynamically updates, reflecting the total number of items in the cart. As items are added or removed, the icon's badge displays the updated count.

Total Cost Calculation: The total cost of the items in the cart is dynamically calculated and displayed in the header. As items are added or removed, the total cost is updated in real-time.
